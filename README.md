#Business Sales Performace Analytics

Hi! 👋 This is one of my first Power BI dashboard projects that I built while learning Data Analytics so this project is part of my journey to understand real‑world data better.

This dashboard helps answer simple but important business questions like:

Which region is giving the most sales?

How are sales changing over time?

Which payment mode do customers use most?

Where should a business focus to grow more? 📈



##🛠️ Tools I Used

📊 Power BI Desktop

📁 Excel / CSV dataset

##🎯 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

KPIs are like the scoreboard of a business. They quickly show how things are going.

In this dashboard I used:

💰 Total Sales → Total revenue earned

📦 Total Orders → How many orders were placed

👤 Total Customers → Number of customers

📈 Profit → Actual earnings after costs

Why KPIs matter 👉 Instead of reading full data tables, we can understand performance in seconds.

Example: If sales are high but profit is low, it means expenses are too high ⚠️

🎛️ Slicers (Filters)

Slicers make the dashboard interactive.
You can click options and see results instantly.

I added slicers like:

📅 Date slicer → Check monthly or yearly sales

🌍 Region slicer → Compare North, South, East, West

💳 Payment Mode slicer → See COD, Cards, etc.

Example 👉 If we select only West region, we can study its performance separately.

📊 Charts & Graphs Explained

I tried to use simple visuals so anyone can understand easily.

🟡 1. Sales by Region (Donut Chart)

Shows percentage of sales from each region.
This helps find which area is strongest.

👉 If West is highest, business can expand there.

💳 2. Sales by Payment Mode (Donut Chart)

Shows how customers pay.
This helps businesses improve payment options.

👉 Example: If COD is most used, maybe customers don’t trust online payments yet.

📈 3. Sales Over Time (Line Chart)

Shows how sales change month by month.
Helps find growth, decline, or festive season spikes 🎉

📦 4. Product Performance (Bar Chart)

Shows which products sell the most.
Helps businesses focus on best‑selling items.

💹 5. Profit by Category

Shows which category gives the most profit.
Because high sales does not always mean high profit.

##🧠 Insights I Found

From this dashboard I noticed things like:

Some regions give more sales 📍

COD is very popular 💵

Some products sell a lot but profit is low ⚠️

Sales increase during special seasons 🎊

These insights help businesses take better decisions.
